# Master-Sim

**Master-Sim** is a project dedicated to developing high-fidelity synthetic data and pre-trained policies for precision assembly tasks in industrial robotics.

## Overview
This project aims to bridge the gap between simulation and reality (Sim-to-Real) for tasks requiring delicate force control, such as peg-in-hole assembly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- MuJoCo

### Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Roadmap
See [docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md) for the detailed business and technical roadmap.
